# The National Rapporteur Challenge
2nd edition of Hackathon for Good

## Deep Learning Resources
If you are developing a deep neural network based solution, you can use the free GPUs provided by either Google Colab or Kaggle. Here are the instructions for both:

### Google Colab:
Go to Google Colab and start a new notebook. You can use the instructions in this notebook to upload your datasets and work on them in Colab. When you need to use GPUs to train your models, switch GPU on under Edit --> Notebook settings. This notebook shows you an example of training a model built in TensorFlow using a GPU.

### Kaggle:
Go to Kaggle and create a user profile. Then, go to Kernels --> New Kernel. A blank notebook opens up, and you can write your code in here. You will see on the right side of the notebook an option to turn on the GPU. On the top right side of your notebook, you will see a symbol that looks like a cloud with an arrow on it. You can click on this to upload your data to Kaggle.

### Other options:
If you have a Google Cloud, or Amazon Web Services, or Paperspace account, etc, you can use one of these to train your models.
